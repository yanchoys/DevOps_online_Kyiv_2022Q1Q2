The word ***DevOps*** is a combination of the terms **development** and **operations**, meant to represent a collaborative or shared approach to the tasks performed by a company's application development and IT operations teams.
## Who is DevOps
In its broadest meaning, DevOps is a philosophy that promotes better communication and collaboration between these teams - and others - in an organization. In its most narrow interpretation, DevOps describes the adoption of iterative software development, automation, and programmable infrastructure deployment and maintenance.
